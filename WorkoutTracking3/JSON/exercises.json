Bring your left foot back into a lunge position while keeping a shallow bend in your right knee. Keep your right knee in line with your ankle, and have the left knee behind slightly bent.\nLean slightly forward. You can either place your left hand (the free hand) on your thigh or on a stable surface in front of you, such as a bench. The surface should be at about knee height.\nEngage your core before you initiate the movement—this is what you’ll need to do in order to maintain a stable support.\nSlowly lower the dumbbell toward the floor until it’s hanging down completely, your elbow straight. However, maintain tension throughout the rest of your body. You don’t want to be arching or rounding your spine or shoulders.\nTo initiate the lift, pull back your shoulder blade towards your spine. Think of your elbow driving up towards the ceiling as you lift the dumbbell while also making sure it stays close to your body. The dumbbell should pass by close to your rib cage.\nAt the top of the movement, engage your rhomboids if you’re able to—your shoulder blades should be squeezing together. At this point in the exercise, the dumbbell should be in line with the chest while the elbow is pointing straight up.\nMaintaining the proper posture throughout, slowly lower the weight back down into the starting position. Repeat for the desired amount of sets and reps, switching arms after each set. ",
